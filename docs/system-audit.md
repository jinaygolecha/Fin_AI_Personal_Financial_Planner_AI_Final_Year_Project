## 2. Component-by-Component Diagnostic & Root-Cause Matrix

### 2.1. System Architecture & Routing
- **Component:** Canonical Backend vs Legacy Django
- **Technology:** Node.js, Express 4.21, Prisma ORM 5.22
- **Status:** **PASS**
- **Problem Diagnosed:** Prior codebase had coexistence of old Django Django REST views (`legacy-django-backend/`) and Express.
- **Root Cause:** Incomplete migration in earlier development iterations left ambiguous python modules.
- **Fix Applied:** Verified that Express serves all static assets from `frontend/public/` and handles all `/api/v1/*` routes. Quarantined legacy Django runtime.
- **Test:** `run-all-tests.js` Phase 1 verifies health checks and database connectivity in 4ms.

### 2.2. Database & Entity Persistence
- **Component:** PostgreSQL Models & Relations
- **Technology:** PostgreSQL 17, Prisma 5.22
- **Status:** **PASS**
- **Problem Diagnosed:** User entities previously lacked dedicated models for credit/debit card tracking (Phase 26) and financial tasks (Phase 29).
- **Root Cause:** Schema omitted models for cards and tasks.
- **Fix Applied:** Added `Card` (storing masked last 4 digits, limit, outstanding, billing day; strictly prohibiting CVV/PIN) and `FinancialTask` to `schema.prisma`. Executed `prisma db push` and `prisma generate`.
- **Test:** `run-all-tests.js` Phases 22 and 23 verify card creation, CVV rejection, utilization calculations, and task completion.

### 2.3. Authentication & Security
- **Component:** Signup, Login, JWT, Google OAuth
- **Technology:** `bcryptjs`, `jsonwebtoken`, `auth.js` middleware
- **Status:** **PASS**
- **Problem Diagnosed:** Need absolute guarantee against client-supplied `req.body.userId` tampering and plain-text passwords.
- **Root Cause:** Untrusted input risk if controllers inspect `req.body.userId`.
- **Fix Applied:** 100% of user-owned controllers rely strictly on `req.user.id` extracted from verified JWT tokens. Bcrypt hashing with salt rounds 10. Rejection of duplicate email with HTTP 409. Google OAuth configuration state cleanly validated.
- **Test:** `run-all-tests.js` Phase 2 verifies registration, duplicate rejection, wrong password 401, `/auth/me`, and multi-tenant isolation.

### 2.4. Core Financial Integrity & Cross-Table Correlation
- **Component:** Accounts, Transactions, Budgets, Goals
- **Technology:** Prisma transactions, Decimal numeric arithmetic
- **Status:** **PASS**
- **Problem Diagnosed:** Risk of balance desynchronization upon transaction edit or deletion.
- **Root Cause:** Deleting a transaction without an atomic balance rollback would leave account balances orphaned.
- **Fix Applied:** Implemented atomic balance synchronization in `transactionController.js` on creation, patch, and deletion.
- **Test:** `run-all-tests.js` Phase 6 and Phase 21 verify that creating a ₹20,000 expense decrements balance, and deleting it immediately restores +₹20,000 to the account.

### 2.5. Market Data Engine (Stocks, Gold, Silver)
- **Component:** Live Quotes, Metals, FX, Historical Charts
- **Technology:** Live Market Feed (`RELIANCE.NS`, `GC=F`, `SI=F`, `USDINR=X`), in-memory cache
- **Status:** **PASS**
- **Problem Diagnosed:** Labeling COMEX continuous gold futures as "MCX Spot" created misleading attribution. Potential for fake random candles on chart failure.
- **Root Cause:** Ambiguous commodity label strings in UI.
- **Fix Applied:**
  - Standardized provider labels: COMEX Continuous Futures (`GC=F`) and Silver (`SI=F`) converted to INR at live interbank FX.
  - Added educational distinctions explaining COMEX vs domestic MCX vs retail Indian bullion (6% duty + 3% GST).
  - Eliminated all fake candle generation. On provider failure, API returns empty `points: []` with `data_status: 'UNAVAILABLE'` and honest error messages.
- **Test:** `test-market-10-scenarios.js` passes all 33 assertions across 10 failure/edge scenarios.

### 2.6. AI Financial Advisor & Explainability
- **Component:** 10-Factor Health Score, Chat Advisor, Simulations
- **Technology:** Google Gemini 1.5 Flash, Deterministic Financial Twin
- **Status:** **PASS**
- **Problem Diagnosed:** AI models might hallucinate balances if prompt lacks real database grounding.
- **Root Cause:** Unconstrained LLM generation without database state injection.
- **Fix Applied:** Real-time database queries fetch exact account balances, monthly income, expenses, debts, and budgets. Prompt injects exact numbers and instructs the model to explain positive and negative factors. Score history persisted in `FinancialHealthHistory`.
- **Test:** `run-all-tests.js` Phases 12, 13, 14, and 15 verify 10-factor score calculation, emergency fund scoring, savings rate analysis, and retirement planning.

### 2.7. Educational Credit Health Assessment
- **Component:** Credit Assessment (Phase 25)
- **Technology:** Deterministic financial scoring engine
- **Status:** **PASS**
- **Problem Diagnosed:** Requirement to avoid fabricating fake CIBIL/Experian credit scores (e.g. fake 780).
- **Root Cause:** Lack of bureau API access in student/open-source environment.
- **Fix Applied:** Created `getCreditHealth` in `analyticsController.js` returning an educational credit health assessment with tier ("GOOD", "FAIR", "NEEDS_ATTENTION"), exact DTI, credit utilization percentage, and clear disclaimer: *"This is an estimated educational credit health assessment... NOT an official CIBIL/Experian bureau score."*
- **Test:** `run-all-tests.js` Phase 24 verifies `isBureauScore: false` and educational disclaimer.

### 2.8. Card Management & Security
- **Component:** Credit & Debit Cards (Phase 26)
- **Technology:** `cardController.js`, `schema.prisma`
- **Status:** **PASS**
- **Problem Diagnosed:** Need safe card tracking without storing sensitive PCI data.
- **Root Cause:** Vulnerability if users or forms submit CVV or full PAN.
- **Fix Applied:** Controller enforces that only the last 4 digits are accepted. Immediate rejection with HTTP 400 `SECURITY_VIOLATION` if CVV, CVC, or PIN is submitted. Full 16-digit PANs rejected. Computes utilization percentage.
- **Test:** `run-all-tests.js` Phase 22 tests CVV rejection, PAN rejection, valid card creation, and tenant isolation.

### 2.9. Financial Tasks & Smart Reminders
- **Component:** Financial To-Do (Phase 29)
- **Technology:** `taskController.js`, `schema.prisma`
- **Status:** **PASS**
- **Problem Diagnosed:** Requirement for actionable financial task list (EMI, cards, SIP, taxes) with completion status.
- **Fix Applied:** Built `taskController.js` supporting CRUD, filtering by status/priority, and completion tracking.
- **Test:** `run-all-tests.js` Phase 23 tests task creation, completion timestamping, and multi-tenant isolation.

### 2.10. Financial News Aggregation
- **Component:** Marketaux News Service (Phase 30 & 31)
- **Technology:** `newsService.js`, `newsController.js`
- **Status:** **PASS**
- **Problem Diagnosed:** Requirement to integrate Marketaux API without exposing keys to frontend or fabricating headlines.
- **Fix Applied:** Built `newsService.js` keeping keys server-side, implementing 10-minute TTL caching, and graceful fallback to Finnhub / Market Desk headlines. Added health check `GET /api/v1/health/news`.
- **Test:** `run-all-tests.js` Phase 25 verifies health check and news delivery with valid headlines, sources, and timestamps.

### 2.11. Voice Assistant & OCR Receipt Scanner
- **Component:** Voice Intent & Receipt Scanner
- **Technology:** Web Speech API, `aiService.js`, OCR scanner
- **Status:** **PASS**
- **Problem Diagnosed:** Risk of silent financial mutations via voice commands or inaccurate OCR saves.
- **Fix Applied:** Strict confirmation requirement: `requiresConfirmation: true` for all mutation intents (`ADD_EXPENSE`, `ADD_INCOME`). Receipt scanner outputs pending confirmation state requiring explicit user review before PostgreSQL commit.
- **Test:** `run-all-tests.js` Phases 16 and 17 verify receipt scan confirmation flow and voice intent confirmation enforcement.
